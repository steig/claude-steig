# Simone

A progressive task management framework that adapts to your project's complexity.

## Overview

Simone is a file-based task management system designed for software development teams. It starts with just 5 essential commands and can scale to comprehensive project management when needed. Built specifically for AI-assisted development workflows, particularly with Claude Code.

**Core Design**: Tasks are markdown files, organization is folders, and complexity is opt-in.

## Attribution

- **Original Framework**: Based on [Simone](https://github.com/helmi/simone) by Helmi, which established the foundational directory-based project management concepts
- **Inspiration**: Command patterns and cognitive personas inspired by [SuperClaude](https://github.com/NomenAK/SuperClaude), providing AI-driven development workflows

## Installation

```bash
# Quick install (30 seconds)
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/simone/main/install-simone.sh | bash

# Or clone and install
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simone
cd simone
./install-simone.sh
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Basic workflow
simone add "Implement user authentication"    # Create task
simone list                                   # View tasks
simone done 1234567                          # Complete task
simone note "API uses JWT tokens"            # Save knowledge
simone find "auth"                           # Search everything
```

## Progressive Complexity

## For Existing Simone Users

If you're using the original Simone framework with full complexity:

```bash
# Analyze current structure
simone-migrate --analyze

# Migrate to appropriate complexity level
simone-migrate

# Or maintain full compatibility
simone-migrate --force-full
```

## Project Structure

```
.simone/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks/       # Active tasks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ done/        # Completed tasks
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ notes/       # Project knowledge

# With progressive modes enabled:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ urgent/      # organize mode
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ normal/      # organize mode
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backlog/     # organize mode
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ @person/     # team mode
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sprints/         # team mode
```

## Integration

### Claude Code Commands
Simone includes Claude Code integration for AI-assisted task management:

```bash
/project:simone:do_task 1234567       # AI task execution
/project:simone:create_pr             # Pull request automation
/project:simone:review                # Code review assistance
```

### Version Control
```bash
# Recommended .gitignore entries
.simone/.cache/
.simone/done/        # Optional: exclude completed tasks
```

## Requirements

- Bash 4.0+
- Git (for version control integration)
- Claude Code (for AI features)
- Docker (optional, for MCP servers)

## Development Status

Simone is actively maintained with regular updates. The framework is used in production by multiple teams but should be evaluated for your specific needs.
