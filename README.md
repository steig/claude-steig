# Simone for Claude Code

## What is this?

Simone is a directory-based project management system designed to work better with Claude Code. It's a sophisticated framework of folders, markdown files, and custom commands that help break down software projects into manageable chunks that AI can handle effectively.

**üôè Attribution**: This is a specialized fork of the original Simone framework created by [Helmi](https://github.com/helmi). The original work provided the foundational concepts and workflow design. This fork adds comprehensive metadata management and project tracking capabilities.

**üé≠ Inspiration**: Cognitive personas and command patterns inspired by [SuperClaude](https://github.com/NomenAK/SuperClaude), which pioneered innovative approaches to AI-driven development workflows and specialized assistant capabilities.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Complexity Warning**: Simone is a sophisticated system that requires time to understand properly. It's not a simple plug-and-play solution, but rather a framework that works best when you take the time to learn how it operates and adapt it to your workflow.

**üö® EXPERIMENTAL WARNING**: This is a rapidly evolving, experimental project. Things move fast here and stuff might break. Features change frequently, commands may be unstable, and documentation might lag behind reality. Use at your own risk and expect the unexpected. YOLO! üé¢

### 2. Initialize Your Project

Open your project in Claude Code and run:

```
/project:simone:initialize
```

This guides you through the basic setup process. Works with new or existing codebases, and can help you create project documentation (PRDs, architecture docs) or work with documents you already have.

### 3. Set Up Your First Milestone

**NEW**: Use AI-powered milestone generation for faster, comprehensive planning:

```
/project:simone:create_milestone "Build user authentication system with JWT tokens, social login, and MFA support"
```

This command will:
- ü§ñ **Analyze your prompt** and extract features, requirements, and constraints
- üìù **Generate comprehensive milestone** with business objectives, success criteria, and risk assessment
- üéØ **Create sprint breakdown** with timeline estimation and dependency mapping
- üìä **Populate all metadata** automatically (30+ YAML fields)
- üîó **Integrate with project** by updating manifest and creating proper directory structure

**Alternative (Manual Setup)**: Create a milestone folder in `.simone/02_REQUIREMENTS/` named `M01_Your_Milestone_Name` (e.g., `M01_Basic_Application`). Include at least:

- `M01_PRD.md` - Product requirements document
- Other specs as needed: `M01_Database_Schema.md`, `M01_API_Specs.md`, etc.

*Use the existing chat from step 2 to guide Claude through manual milestone creation, ensuring proper naming with the `M##_` prefix and underscores.*

### 4. Break Down into Sprints

```
/project:simone:create_sprints_from_milestone
```

This analyzes your milestone and breaks it down into logical sprints. It looks at the entire scope and creates meaningful sprint boundaries without detailed tasks yet.

### 5. Create Your First Tasks

```
/project:simone:create_sprint_tasks
```

This analyzes your sprints, reviews documentation, researches necessary information, and identifies knowledge gaps to gain comprehensive understanding of your project. Creates detailed, actionable tasks for the current sprint.

*Important: Only create tasks for your next sprint, not all sprints upfront. After completing Sprint 1, then create tasks for Sprint 2. This ensures the system can reference your existing codebase and incorporate completed work into future task creation.*

### 6. Start Working - Choose Your Workflow

**ü§ñ Automated Workflow (NEW - Recommended for Routine Tasks)**:

### 7. Task Status Management

```
/project:simone:update_task_status T01_S01 in_progress
```

The `update_task_status` command provides comprehensive status management with full metadata tracking:

- **Status transitions**: pending ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí review ‚Üí completed (and blocked states)
- **Metadata updates**: Automatically updates YAML frontmatter with timestamps, effort tracking, and progress
- **Content updates**: Updates task sections based on status (logs, checklists, etc.)
- **Integration**: Updates project manifest and sprint tracking
- **Quality gates**: Ensures all acceptance criteria are met before completion

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Start working on a task
/project:simone:update_task_status T01_S01 in_progress

# Mark ready for review with time tracking  
/project:simone:update_task_status T01_S01 review 3.5

# Complete a task
/project:simone:update_task_status T01_S01 completed 4
```

**Important**: Simone is a complex system, not a simple set-and-forget tool. It works best when you understand how it operates. Take time to read through the commands and consider adapting them to your workflow.

## MCP Server Integration

Simone now includes automatic integration with multiple MCP servers that provide comprehensive IDE assistance, project management, and context management capabilities.

### Automatic Setup

All MCP servers are automatically installed during project initialization:

```bash
# Installed automatically during /project:simone:initialize
claude mcp add serena -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena serena-mcp-server --context ide-assistant --project $(pwd)
claude mcp add context7 -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/upstash/context7 context7-mcp-server
claude mcp add playwright -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp playwright-mcp-server
claude mcp add work-history -- uvx mcp-work-history
claude mcp add sequential-thinking -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers.git --subdirectory src/sequentialthinking mcp-server-sequentialthinking
```

### Capabilities

**Serena** provides:
- **Enhanced IDE assistance** and code analysis
- **Improved project management** capabilities  
- **Context-aware development** support throughout Simone operations

**Context7** provides:
- **Advanced context management** and retrieval

**Sequential Thinking** provides:
- **Structured reasoning** and step-by-step problem-solving capabilities
- **Enhanced logical thinking** for complex development challenges
- **Systematic approach** to breaking down and solving technical problems

### Usage

Every time you prime your knowledge with `/project:simone:prime`, all MCP servers are automatically initialized:

1. **Verifies MCP server status** to ensure all are active
2. **Loads Serena instructions** with `/mcp__serena__initial_instructions`
3. **Ensures proper configuration** for using all MCP tools

**Important**: Always run `/mcp__serena__initial_instructions` when starting a new conversation or after any compacting operation to ensure Claude remains properly configured to use Serena's tools.

## How it Works

Simone organizes your project into:

- **Milestones**: Major features or project phases
- **Sprints**: Groups of related tasks within a milestone
- **Tasks**: Individual work items scoped for one Claude session

Each task gets full project context so Claude knows exactly what to build and how it fits into your architecture.

```

## üìã Completion Naming Convention

Simone uses a consistent "X" prefix to mark completed work items, providing clear visual distinction between active and finished work:

- **Tasks**: `T001` ‚Üí `TX001` (completed)
- **Sprints**: `S01_M01` ‚Üí `SX01_M01` (completed)  
- **Milestones**: `M01` ‚Üí `MX01` (completed)
- **Bugs**: `BUG001` ‚Üí `BUGX001` (resolved)

This convention makes it easy to filter active work, maintain project history, and track completion progress across all work item types. All completed items retain their full context and remain accessible for reference.

## Why I built this

AI coding tools have become incredibly powerful, but they all face the same fundamental challenge: context management. The context window is limited in size, and we have little control over what stays in context and what doesn't.

The problem with long-running sessions is context decay - as you work, critical project knowledge silently falls off the end of the context window. You don't know what's been forgotten until something goes wrong.

My solution: Start fresh for each task, but provide rich surrounding context. By keeping tasks focused and well-scoped, I can dedicate more of the context window to relevant project knowledge, requirements, and architectural decisions. This way:

- Each task starts with exactly the project context it needs
- No critical knowledge gets lost in long sessions
- Claude can work confidently with full awareness of requirements
- The surrounding context guides development, not just the task description

The result is a task-based workflow where Claude always has the right context for the job at hand.

## Key Components

### 00_PROJECT_MANIFEST.md

The central document containing the project's vision, goals, and high-level overview. It serves as the starting point for Claude to understand the project. **Important**: The manifest file must be named exactly `00_PROJECT_MANIFEST.md`, not `MANIFEST.md`.

### 01_PROJECT_DOCS/

Contains general project documentation including technical specifications, user guides, and API documentation that Claude can reference.

### 02_REQUIREMENTS/

Organized by milestones, this directory stores product requirements documents (PRDs) and their amendments, providing a clear view of what needs to be built. This helps Claude understand the project requirements. Milestone folders follow the naming convention `M##_Milestone_Name/` (e.g., `M01_Backend_Setup/`). Completed milestones use `MX##_Milestone_Name/` for clear distinction.

### 03_SPRINTS/

Contains sprint plans and task definitions organized by milestone and sprint sequence. Each sprint folder contains individual task files with detailed information for Claude to work on. Sprint folders follow `S##_M##_Sprint_Name/` format, with completed sprints using `SX##_M##_Sprint_Name/`.

### 04_GENERAL_TASKS/

Stores task definitions for work not tied to a specific sprint. Completed tasks use a `TX` prefix (e.g., `TX001_Completed_Task.md`), making it easy for Claude to identify what's been done.

### 05_ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS/

Captures significant architectural decisions as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), documenting the context, options considered, and rationale. This provides critical context for Claude when making technical decisions. Uses a structured ADR template for consistency.

### 06_BUGS/

Bug tracking and resolution documentation. Bug reports follow the naming convention `BUG###_Bug_Description.md` (e.g., `BUG001_Login_Validation_Error.md`). Resolved bugs use `BUGX###_Bug_Description.md` for clear status distinction and historical tracking.

### 10_STATE_OF_PROJECT/

Contains timestamped project review snapshots created by the `project_review` command. These provide a historical record of project health, technical decisions, and progress over time.

### 99_TEMPLATES/

Contains comprehensive, templates for all document types:

**Core Templates:**
- **`task_template.md`** - Detailed task structure with requirements, implementation, testing, and quality control
- **`sprint_meta_template.md`** - Sprint planning with goals, capacity, and quality standards
- **`milestone_meta_template.md`** - Comprehensive milestone tracking with success metrics
- **`project_manifest_template.md`** - Advanced project overview with metadata and health tracking

**Specialized Templates:**
- **`adr_template.md`** - Comprehensive Architecture Decision Records with detailed analysis
- **`architecture_template.md`** - Complete architecture documentation framework
- **`prd_template.md`** - Product Requirements Document template

## Configuration Tips

### Enabling Parallel Task Execution

While Simone commands like `create_sprint_tasks` support the `useParallelSubagents` instruction, Claude Code needs to be configured to actually execute tasks in parallel. By default, it only runs one task at a time.

To enable parallel execution:

```bash
# Set the number of parallel tasks (example: 3)
claude config set --global "parallelTasksCount" 3

# Check your current configuration
claude config list -g
```

**Important considerations:**

- Choose the number based on your system's capabilities and rate limits
- Parallel execution increases API usage significantly
- Some tasks may have conflicts when run in parallel
- Start with a small number (2-3) and adjust based on your experience
