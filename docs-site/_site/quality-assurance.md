# Quality Assurance Workflow

Comprehensive guide for implementing and maintaining quality standards throughout the development lifecycle using the Simone Framework.

## Overview

Quality Assurance in Simone is not a phase but a continuous process integrated into every workflow. This guide covers quality gates, review processes, testing strategies, and compliance tracking to ensure consistent, high-quality deliverables.

## Quality Gates Configuration

### Project-Level Quality Standards

Define quality gates in `.simone/00_PROJECT_MANIFEST.md`:

```yaml
quality_gates:
  code_review_required: true
  automated_testing_required: true
  documentation_required: true
  security_scan_required: true
  performance_testing_required: true
  accessibility_testing_required: true

quality_thresholds:
  minimum_test_coverage: 80
  maximum_complexity: 10
  documentation_coverage: 90
  performance_budget:
    page_load_time: 3000  # ms
    api_response_time: 200  # ms
  security_score: "A"
  accessibility_score: 95

compliance_requirements:
  - "OWASP Top 10"
  - "WCAG 2.1 AA"
  - "SOC2 Type II"
  - "GDPR"
```

### Task-Level Quality Requirements

Each task includes quality criteria:

```yaml
quality_requirements:
  test_coverage: 85
  code_review_status: "approved"
  documentation_complete: true
  performance_impact: "neutral"
  security_review: "passed"
  
acceptance_criteria:
  - "All unit tests passing"
  - "Integration tests cover happy path"
  - "No regression in performance benchmarks"
  - "API documentation updated"
  - "Security scan shows no new vulnerabilities"
```

## Code Quality Workflow

### Pre-Development Quality

   - [ ] Dependencies are identified
   - [ ] Risk assessment is complete

2. **Design Review**:
   - Architecture alignment check
   - Design pattern validation
   - Security design review
   - Performance impact assessment
   - Scalability considerations

### During Development Quality

1. **Continuous Integration Checks**:
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/quality-checks.yml
   name: Quality Gates
   on: [push, pull_request]
   
   jobs:
     quality:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Code Linting
           run: npm run lint
         
         - name: Type Checking
           run: npm run typecheck
         
         - name: Unit Tests
           run: npm test -- --coverage
         
         - name: Coverage Check
           run: |
             if [ $(coverage) -lt 80 ]; then
               echo "Coverage below 80%"
               exit 1
             fi
   ```

2. **Pre-Commit Hooks**:
   ```bash
   # .git/hooks/pre-commit
   #!/bin/bash
   
   # Run linting
   npm run lint || exit 1
   
   # Check for console.logs
   if grep -r "console.log" src/; then
     echo "Remove console.log statements"
     exit 1
   fi
   
   # Validate task references
   if ! git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E "(TASK_|T[0-9]{3})"; then
     echo "Commit must reference a task"
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

       content-type: application/json
       body:
         token: string, JWT token
         user: object, user profile
     401:

  vulnerabilities_found: 2
  severity_high: 0
  severity_medium: 1
  severity_low: 1
  remediation_status:
    - issue: "Weak password policy"
      severity: "medium"
      status: "fixed"
      fixed_in: "TASK_045"
    - issue: "Missing rate limiting"
      severity: "low"
      status: "in_progress"
      assigned_to: "TASK_067"
```

## Performance Quality

### Performance Standards

Define performance budgets:

```yaml
performance_budgets:
  web_vitals:
    LCP: 2500  # Largest Contentful Paint (ms)
    FID: 100   # First Input Delay (ms)
    CLS: 0.1   # Cumulative Layout Shift
  api_performance:
    p50_response_time: 100  # ms
    p95_response_time: 500  # ms
    p99_response_time: 1000 # ms
  database_performance:
    query_timeout: 5000     # ms
    connection_pool: 20
    slow_query_log: 1000    # ms
```

### Performance Testing

1. **Load Testing**:
   ```
   /project:simone:test performance load
   ```

2. **Stress Testing**:
   ```
   /project:simone:test performance stress
   ```

3. **Performance Monitoring**:
   ```javascript
   // Performance tracking
   performance.mark('api-call-start');
   const response = await fetchAPI();
   performance.mark('api-call-end');
   performance.measure('api-call', 'api-call-start', 'api-call-end');
   
   const measure = performance.getEntriesByName('api-call')[0];
   if (measure.duration > 500) {
     console.warn(`Slow API call: ${measure.duration}ms`);
   }
   ```

## Compliance Tracking

### Regulatory Compliance

Track compliance requirements:

```yaml
compliance_tracking:
  GDPR:
    status: "compliant"
    last_audit: "2024-02-15"

    requirements:
      - "Data portability implemented"
      - "Right to erasure functional"
      - "Privacy by design documented"
      - "DPO appointed"
  
  SOC2:
    status: "in_progress"
    target_date: "2024-06-01"
    completed_controls: 45
    total_controls: 67
    
  WCAG:
    status: "partial"
    level: "AA"
    score: 87
    issues: ["Color contrast in dark mode", "Missing alt text"]
```

### Audit Preparation

       script: npm run lint
       allow_failure: false
     
     - stage: test
       script: npm test -- --coverage
       coverage: /Coverage: \d+\.\d+%/
       
     - stage: security
       script: npm audit && snyk test
       
     - stage: performance
       script: lighthouse ci
       
     - stage: documentation
       script: npm run docs:validate
   ```

2. **Automated Reporting**:
   ```javascript
   // Generate quality report
   async function generateQualityReport() {
     const metrics = {
       coverage: await getTestCoverage(),
       complexity: await getCodeComplexity(),
       security: await getSecurityScore(),
       performance: await getPerformanceMetrics(),
       documentation: await getDocCoverage()
     };
     
     return formatReport(metrics);
   }
   ```

3. **Quality Bots**:
   - PR size warnings

5. **Fix Immediately**: Don't let quality debt accumulate

### Team Quality Culture

1. **Shared Ownership**: Everyone owns quality
2. **Learning Culture**: Share quality failures openly
3. **Celebrate Success**: Recognize quality achievements
4. **Continuous Learning**: Regular training and updates
5. **Tool Investment**: Provide best quality tools

### Quality Communication

1. **Transparent Metrics**: Share quality dashboards
2. **Regular Updates**: Weekly quality summaries
3. **Stakeholder Education**: Explain quality value
4. **Success Stories**: Share quality wins
5. **Incident Learning**: Post-mortems for quality failures
