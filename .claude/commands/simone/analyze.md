## DETAILS on every TODO item

### 1. Parse analysis target and define analysis scope

**MCP INTEGRATION:** Sequential Thinking + Serena for systematic analysis approach

**Sequential Thinking Usage:**
- Structure the analysis process systematically
- Break down complex analysis into manageable components

**Serena MCP Usage:**
- Use `/mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview` to understand codebase structure
- Use `/mcp__serena__list_dir` to analyze project organization
- Use `/mcp__serena__think_about_collected_information` before proceeding

Check: <$ARGUMENTS>

**Scope Definition:**
- IDENTIFY specific files, modules, or system components to analyze
- DEFINE analysis depth and focus areas
- ESTABLISH success criteria for analysis completion
- DETERMINE which analysis types to execute

### 2. Execute comprehensive code scanning and metric collection

**MCP INTEGRATION:** Sequential Thinking + Serena for comprehensive scanning

**Serena MCP Usage:**
- Use `/mcp__serena__find_symbol` to locate specific code elements
- Use `/mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols` to analyze dependencies
- Use `/mcp__serena__search_for_pattern` to find code patterns

**Code Scanning:**
- SCAN target codebase for patterns and metrics using Serena tools
- COLLECT complexity metrics (cyclomatic, cognitive)
- GATHER size metrics (lines of code, file counts)
- IDENTIFY code duplication and similarity patterns

- EVALUATE database query efficiency
- IDENTIFY optimization opportunities

### 6. Conduct security analysis and vulnerability assessment

**MCP INTEGRATION:** Sequential Thinking for security assessment

**Security Analysis:**
- SCAN for common security vulnerabilities
- ASSESS input validation and sanitization
- EVALUATE authentication and authorization patterns
- IDENTIFY potential data exposure risks
- ASSESS compliance with security best practices

### 7. Analyze dependency relationships and technical debt

**MCP INTEGRATION:** GitHub for debt pattern analysis

**Dependency Analysis:**
- MAP dependency relationships and coupling
- IDENTIFY circular dependencies and tight coupling

**Findings Generation:**
- SYNTHESIZE analysis results into prioritized findings
- CATEGORIZE issues by severity and impact
- RECOMMEND specific improvement actions
- ESTIMATE effort required for remediation
- PRIORITIZE recommendations by value and feasibility

### 9. Create structured analysis report with improvement suggestions

**CRITICAL:** Output comprehensive analysis documentation

**Report Structure:**
```
