# Code Review - Execute top to bottom

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEPRECATED**: This command has been merged into the unified review system. Use `/project:simone:review --type-code` instead for comprehensive code review capabilities. This command will be removed in v3.0.0.
>
> **Migration**: Use `/project:simone:review --type-code --persona-security --persona-analyzer` instead.

Use the following instructions from top to bottom to execute a Code Review.

## Create a TODO with EXACTLY these 6 Items

1. Analyze the Scope given
2. Find code changes within Scope
3. Find relevant Specification and Documentation
4. Compare code changes against Documentation and Requirements
5. Analyze possible differences
6. Provide PASS/FAIL verdict with details

Follow step by step and adhere closely to the following instructions for each step.

## DETAILS on every TODO item

### 1. Analyze the Scope given

**MCP INTEGRATION:** Use MCP servers to enhance code review process:
- **Serena**: Get enhanced code analysis and quality insights
- **Sequential Thinking**: Structure the review process systematically
- **GitHub**: Reference previous code reviews and their outcomes

check: <$ARGUMENTS>

If empty, use default, otherwise interpret <$ARGUMENTS> to identify the scope of the Review. Only continue if you can find meaningful changes to review.

**CONTEXT:** Before reviewing code changes:

- Read `.simone/00_PROJECT_MANIFEST.md` to understand current sprint and milestone context
- Use the manifest to identify which sprint is active and what work is in scope
- Only evaluate against requirements appropriate for the current sprint's deliverables

### 2. Find code changes within Scope

With the identified Scope use `git diff` (on default: `git diff HEAD~1`) to find code changes.

### 3. Find relevant Specifications and Documentation

- FIND the Task, Sprint and Milestone involved in the work that was done and output your findings
- Navigate to `.simone/03_SPRINTS/` to find the current sprint directory
- READ the sprint meta file to understand sprint objectives and deliverables
- If a specific task is in scope, find and READ the task file in the sprint directory
- IDENTIFY related requirements in `.simone/02_REQUIREMENTS/` for the current milestone
- READ involved Documents especially in `.simone/01_PROJECT_DOCS/` and `.simone/02_REQUIREMENTS/`
- **IMPORTANT:** Focus on current sprint deliverables, not future milestone features

### 4. Compare code changes against Documentation and Requirements

### 5. Analyze the differences

- Analyze any difference found
- Give every issue a Severity Score
- Severity ranges from 1 (low) to 10 (high)
- Remember List of issues and Scores for output

### 6. Provide PASS/FAIL verdict with details

- Call a **FAIL** on any differences found.
  - Zero Tolerance - even on well meant additions.
  - Leave it on the user to decide if small changes are allowed.
- Only **PASS** if no discrepancy appeared.

#### TECHNICAL DEBT INTEGRATION

**If Technical Debt Items Identified During Review:**

1. **Document Debt Items:**
   - Create debt items for significant technical debt discovered
   - Use `technical_debt_template.md` from `.simone/99_TEMPLATES/`
   - Place in `.simone/07_TECHNICAL_DEBT/ACTIVE/`
   - Reference in code review findings

2. **Categorize Debt Severity:**
   - **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, performance blockers
   - **High**: Maintainability issues, design violations
   - **Medium**: Code quality concerns, missing documentation
   - **Low**: Style violations, minor improvements

3. **Include in Review Results:**
   - List identified debt items in review findings
   - Reference TD_### IDs for trackability
   - Include impact assessment and recommended timeline

#### IMPORTANT: Output Format

- Output the results of your review to the task's **## Output Log** section in the task file
- Find the task file in `.simone/03_SPRINTS/` or `.simone/04_GENERAL_TASKS/` based on the scope
- Append the review results to the existing Output Log with timestamp
- Output Format:
  ```
  [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]: Code Review - PASS/FAIL
  Result: **FAIL/PASS** Your final decision on if it's a PASS or a FAIL.
  **Scope:** Inform the user about the review scope.
  **Findings:** Detailed list with all Issues found and Severity Score.
  **Technical Debt:** List any debt items identified (TD_### references).
  **Summary:** Short summary on what is wrong or not.
  **Recommendation:** Your personal recommendation on further steps.
