## DETAILS on every TODO item

### 1. Parse research query and define investigation scope

**MCP INTEGRATION:** Sequential Thinking for structured research approach

Check: <$ARGUMENTS>

**Research Query Processing:**
- EXTRACT key search terms and investigation focus
- DEFINE scope boundaries and research depth
- IDENTIFY specific files, modules, or patterns to investigate
- ESTABLISH success criteria for research completion

### 2. Execute comprehensive codebase scanning and pattern identification

**MCP INTEGRATION:** Sequential Thinking + Context7 for pattern recognition

**Scanning Strategy:**
- SEARCH for relevant code patterns and implementations
- IDENTIFY similar functionality across different modules
- ANALYZE naming conventions and organizational patterns
- MAP relationships between components and modules

### 3. Analyze implementation approaches and architectural decisions

**MCP INTEGRATION:** Context7 for understanding design evolution

**Implementation Analysis:**
- EVALUATE different approaches found in codebase
- COMPARE implementation strategies and trade-offs
- IDENTIFY architectural decision patterns
- ASSESS consistency across similar implementations

### 4. Investigate dependencies, libraries, and technology stack

**MCP INTEGRATION:** Sequential Thinking for systematic dependency analysis

**Technology Investigation:**
- ANALYZE package.json, requirements.txt, or equivalent dependency files
- RESEARCH library usage patterns and integration approaches
- IDENTIFY version compatibility and update opportunities
- ASSESS technology stack coherence and optimization potential

### 5. Research best practices and industry standards comparison

**MCP INTEGRATION:** Context7 for industry knowledge integration

**Best Practices Research:**
- COMPARE current implementation with industry standards
- IDENTIFY opportunities for improvement and modernization
- RESEARCH emerging patterns and technologies
- EVALUATE security and performance best practices alignment

### 6. Identify knowledge gaps and learning opportunities

**MCP INTEGRATION:** Sequential Thinking for gap analysis

**Knowledge Gap Assessment:**
- IDENTIFY areas requiring deeper investigation
- SUGGEST learning resources and documentation
- RECOMMEND experimentation or proof-of-concept areas
- PRIORITIZE knowledge acquisition based on impact

### 7. Generate research findings and recommendations

**MCP INTEGRATION:** Serena for enhanced analysis synthesis

**Findings Compilation:**
- SYNTHESIZE research results into actionable insights
- PRIORITIZE findings by importance and implementation difficulty
- RECOMMEND specific improvement approaches
- SUGGEST follow-up research or experimentation

### 8. Create actionable research report with next steps

**CRITICAL:** Output structured research documentation

**Report Generation:**
- SAVE research findings to `.simone/10_STATE_OF_PROJECT/research_[topic]_[timestamp].md`
- SUGGEST specific tasks or milestones based on findings
- RECOMMEND follow-up commands for implementation
- PROVIDE learning resources and next steps
