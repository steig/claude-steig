## 1. Context & Problem Statement

### Background
The Simone Framework represents a sophisticated AI-powered development platform that goes far beyond traditional project management. It includes:
- 23+ Claude Code commands for automated workflows
- AI-powered milestone generation and task breakdown
- Cognitive personas for domain-specific expertise
- Comprehensive metadata tracking with 30+ fields per task
- Advanced template system (14 specialized templates)
- Technical debt and architectural decision tracking
- MCP server integration for enhanced AI capabilities

### Problem Statement
As the development team scales to multiple developers, concerns have emerged about potential merge conflicts and collaboration friction when multiple team members work simultaneously on Simone project files committed to the repository.

### Current Situation
- **File-based project management**: All project data stored in `.simone/` directory structure
- **Rich metadata system**: Comprehensive YAML frontmatter tracking
- **AI automation**: Extensive Claude Code integration for workflow automation
- **Single source of truth**: All project state maintained in committed files
- **Innovation advantage**: Unique AI-powered features not available in standard tools

### Driving Forces
- **Business Drivers**: 
  - Scale development team without collaboration friction
  - Maintain competitive advantage from AI-powered automation
  - Preserve investment in Simone Framework development
  - Ensure project visibility and transparency

- **Technical Drivers**: 
  - Reduce merge conflict potential in project management files
  - Leverage GitHub's proven collaboration features
  - Maintain rich metadata and automation capabilities
  - Enable cross-team project coordination

- **External Drivers**: 
  - Industry standard adoption of GitHub for project tracking
  - Team familiarity with GitHub workflows
  - Integration with existing GitHub-based CI/CD pipelines

### Constraints
- **Technical Constraints**: 
  - GitHub Issues have limited metadata compared to Simone's rich YAML system
  - GitHub Projects lack AI-powered automation capabilities
  - Loss of sophisticated template system and cognitive personas

- **Business Constraints**: 
  - Cannot afford to lose competitive advantage from AI automation
  - Must maintain current development velocity
  - Limited budget for custom GitHub App development

- **Time Constraints**: 
  - Need solution within Q1 2025 as team scales
  - Cannot afford lengthy migration that disrupts current projects

- **Resource Constraints**: 
  - Limited DevOps resources for custom integration development
  - Team learning curve for new workflows

## 2. Decision

### Core Decision
Implement a **Hybrid Integration Approach** that:
1. **Migrates basic task tracking** to GitHub Issues and Projects
2. **Preserves Simone's AI-powered automation** and rich metadata system
3. **Develops integration bridges** for bidirectional synchronization
4. **Maintains current development velocity** while enabling better collaboration

### Rationale
The analysis reveals that Simone Framework is not merely a project management system but a revolutionary AI-powered development platform. Complete migration to GitHub would result in significant loss of competitive advantage and development efficiency. The hybrid approach maximizes benefits while addressing collaboration concerns.
