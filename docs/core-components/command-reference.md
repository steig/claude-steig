# Command Reference

Complete reference for all Simone Framework commands available in Claude Code.

## Overview

The Simone Framework provides a comprehensive suite of specialized commands for project management, development workflow, quality assurance, and safety management. Each command is designed to work seamlessly with the `.simone/` directory structure and project documentation.

**Framework Evolution**: As of v3.0.0, the framework has been streamlined with:
- **Unified command interfaces** reducing cognitive overhead
- **Integrated automation workflows** minimizing manual steps
- **Consolidated templates** eliminating duplication
- **Built-in quality validation** replacing standalone scripts
- **üîí Quality Enforcement System**: Garbage-in, garbage-out prevention with intelligent input validation
- **Progressive quality gates**: Escalating restrictions based on input quality history
- **Real-time quality scoring**: 10-point system with actionable feedback

**üé≠ Enhanced with Cognitive Personas**: Many commands support domain-specific expertise through cognitive personas, inspired by [SuperClaude](https://github.com/NomenAK/SuperClaude)'s pioneering work in specialized AI assistance patterns.

## Streamlined Command Structure

**Recommended Command Flow for v3.0.0+**:

**Key Simplifications**:
- **Unified Review System**: Single `review` command with type flags replaces 4 separate commands
- **Automated Task Execution**: `do_task_auto` handles complete workflow from start to PR
- **Integrated Quality Gates**: Built-in validation eliminates need for separate validation scripts
- **Streamlined PR Creation**: `create_pr_auto` provides comprehensive automation with approval gates
- **Hierarchical Completion Tracking**: Automatic status propagation from tasks ‚Üí sprints ‚Üí milestones ‚Üí project
- **Metadata Synchronization**: `sync_metadata` ensures consistency across all tracking levels
