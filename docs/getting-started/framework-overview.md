# Framework Overview

**Purpose**: Comprehensive introduction to Simone framework concepts and philosophy  
**Audience**: All team members, especially newcomers to the framework  
**Reading Time**: 15 minutes

## What is Simone?

Simone is a sophisticated, directory-based project management framework specifically designed for AI-assisted enterprise software development. It bridges traditional project management disciplines with modern AI-driven development workflows, providing comprehensive metadata management, architectural decision tracking, and integrated quality control processes.

## Core Philosophy

### The Context Problem

Traditional AI coding sessions face a fundamental challenge: **context decay**. As development sessions grow longer, critical project knowledge silently falls off the end of the context window. You don't know what's been forgotten until something goes wrong.

### The Simone Solution

**Start fresh for each task, but provide rich surrounding context.**

```mermaid

    B --> C[Lost Knowledge]
    C --> D[Poor Decisions]
    
    E[Task-Based Sessions] --> F[Rich Context Loading]
    F --> G[Consistent Knowledge]
    G --> H[Quality Decisions]
    
    style A fill:#ffebee
    style D fill:#ffebee
    style E fill:#e8f5e8
    style H fill:#e8f5e8
```

By keeping tasks focused and well-scoped, Simone dedicates more of the context window to relevant project knowledge, requirements, and architectural decisions, ensuring:

- ‚úÖ **Each task starts with exactly the project context it needs**
- ‚úÖ **No critical knowledge gets lost in long sessions**
- ‚úÖ **Claude can work confidently with full awareness of requirements**
- ‚úÖ **The surrounding context guides development, not just the task description**

## Framework Architecture

### Directory Structure Philosophy

Simone organizes projects hierarchically, reflecting natural project management flow:

```
.simone/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 00_PROJECT_MANIFEST.md          # Central project reference
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01_PROJECT_DOCS/                # General documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02_REQUIREMENTS/                # Business requirements by milestone
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ M##_Milestone_Name/         # Strategic milestone containers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 03_SPRINTS/                     # Execution sprints by milestone
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ S##_M##_Sprint_Name/        # Tactical sprint containers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 04_GENERAL_TASKS/               # Non-sprint work items
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 05_ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS/     # Technical decision records
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 06_BUGS/                        # Bug tracking and resolution
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 07_TECHNICAL_DEBT/              # Technical debt tracking and management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 10_STATE_OF_PROJECT/            # Project health snapshots
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 99_TEMPLATES/                   # Standardized templates
```

### Naming Conventions

Simone uses consistent naming patterns that enable:
- **Automatic sorting** and navigation
- **Cross-reference linking** between documents
- **Tool integration** and automation
- **Visual organization** in file explorers

#### Key Patterns
- **Project Manifest**: `00_PROJECT_MANIFEST.md` (exact name required)
- **Milestones**: `M##_Milestone_Name/` (e.g., `M01_Backend_Setup/`)
- **Sprints**: `S##_M##_Sprint_Name/` (e.g., `S01_M01_Initial_API/`)
- **Tasks**: `TASK_##_S##_Task_Name.md` or `TASK_###_Task_Name.md`
- **Technical Debt**: `TD_###_brief_description.md` (e.g., `TD_001_duplicate_validation.md`)
- **ADRs**: `ADR_###_Decision_Topic.md`

## Core Concepts

### 1. Hierarchical Organization

#### Strategic Level: Milestones
- **Purpose**: Major business objectives and feature releases
- **Duration**: 4-12 weeks typically
- **Scope**: Significant user value delivery
- **Documentation**: PRDs, technical specifications, business requirements

#### Tactical Level: Sprints  
- **Purpose**: Logical groups of related implementation tasks
- **Duration**: 1-3 weeks typically
- **Scope**: Coherent technical deliverables
- **Documentation**: Sprint plans, task breakdowns, execution tracking

#### Operational Level: Tasks
- **Purpose**: Individual work items scoped for one Claude session
- **Duration**: 1-4 hours typically
- **Scope**: Specific, testable implementations
- **Documentation**: Detailed implementation guidance and quality checklists

### 2. Metadata-Driven Management

Every document includes rich YAML frontmatter providing:

```yaml
# Example task metadata (21+ fields)
task_id: "task-01-s01"
task_title: "Implement user authentication"
task_type: "feature"
status: "pending"
priority: "high"
complexity: "medium"
estimated_effort: "3.5"
business_value: "high"
technical_value: "medium"
dependencies: ["task-00-s01"]
# ... and many more fields
```

**Benefits**:
- üîç **Searchability** - Find work by any metadata dimension

### "Too much overhead for small projects"
**Reality**: Simone scales from individual projects to enterprise deployments. Small projects benefit from the structure and quality standards, while larger projects leverage the full governance and coordination features.

### "AI will do everything automatically"
**Reality**: Simone enhances human decision-making with AI assistance. Strategic decisions, architecture choices, and business priorities still require human judgment and oversight.

### "Only works with Claude Code"
**Reality**: While optimized for Claude Code, Simone's templates and processes provide value for any development approach. The metadata and documentation standards improve any development workflow.
