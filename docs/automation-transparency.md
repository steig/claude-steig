### ⏸️ Automation Checkpoints System

Human approval gates at critical automation decision points.

#### Enable Checkpoints
```bash
# Enable checkpoints for future automation sessions
simone checkpoints enable

# Configure default checkpoint settings
# Creates .simone/.cache/checkpoint-config.json with:
{
  "enabled": true,
  "default_checkpoints": [
    "task_analysis",
    "implementation_plan", 
    "code_changes",
    "testing_validation",
    "commit_preparation"
  ],
  "approval_timeout": 3600,
  "auto_approve_low_risk": false,
  "notification_enabled": true
}
```

#### Monitor Checkpoint Status
```bash
simone checkpoints list

# Example output:
🔄 Automation Checkpoints
=========================

📋 Active Session: T001_User_Login
🎯 Status: waiting_for_approval
📍 Current Checkpoint: implementation_plan

📚 Checkpoint History:
--------------------
✅ task_analysis (2025-07-15T10:30:00Z)
⏳ implementation_plan (waiting for approval)
⭕ code_changes (pending)
⭕ testing_validation (pending)  
⭕ commit_preparation (pending)

💡 Next Action: simone checkpoints approve
```

#### Approve/Reject Checkpoints
```bash
# Approve current checkpoint
simone checkpoints approve

# Example interaction:
✅ Checkpoint Approval
=====================

📍 Current Checkpoint: implementation_plan

Implementation Plan Summary:
• Database: Create users table with email, password_hash, created_at
• API: POST /api/auth/login, POST /api/auth/logout, GET /api/auth/me
• Frontend: LoginForm component with validation
• Security: JWT tokens, bcrypt hashing, rate limiting
• Tests: Unit tests for auth logic, integration tests for endpoints

Review the checkpoint details above. Approve and continue? (y/N): y

✅ Checkpoint approved: implementation_plan
🔄 Automation will continue from this point
💡 Use 'simone checkpoints status' to monitor progress
```

```bash
# Reject checkpoint with reason
simone checkpoints reject

# Example interaction:
❌ Checkpoint Rejection
======================

Reason for rejection (optional): Need to use OAuth2 instead of JWT for compliance

Reject checkpoint 'implementation_plan'? This will stop automation. (y/N): y

❌ Checkpoint rejected: implementation_plan
🛑 Automation has been stopped
📝 Reason: Need to use OAuth2 instead of JWT for compliance
💡 You can continue manually with: /project:simone:do_task T001
```

#### Checkpoint Types

**Default Checkpoints**:
1. **Task Analysis**: Verify task understanding and approach
2. **Implementation Plan**: Review technical approach and architecture
3. **Code Changes**: Approve actual code modifications before execution
4. **Testing Validation**: Review test strategy and quality gates
5. **Commit Preparation**: Final review before committing changes

}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Checkpoints Not Triggering**:
```bash
# Verify checkpoints are enabled
simone checkpoints list

# Check configuration
cat .simone/.cache/checkpoint-config.json

# Re-enable if needed
simone checkpoints enable
```

**Decision Logging Not Working**:
```bash
# Check if logging is enabled
simone decisions list

# Enable logging
simone decisions enable

# Verify log file exists
ls -la .simone/.cache/decision-log.json
```

**Rollback Issues**:
```bash
# Check git status
git status

# Verify rollback points
simone rollback

# Use safe auto-rollback
simone rollback --auto
```

## Security Considerations

### Decision Log Security
- Decision logs may contain sensitive technical details
- Logs are stored locally in `.simone/.cache/`
- Consider log retention policies for sensitive projects
- Export logs securely when sharing with team members

### Checkpoint Security
- Checkpoint approval is user-controlled locally
- No automation proceeds without explicit approval
- Rejected checkpoints stop automation completely
- Checkpoint history maintains audit trail

### Export Security  
- Exported data includes project metadata and decision history
- Review export contents before sharing externally
- Use backup format for complete data preservation
- Consider data sensitivity when choosing export formats
