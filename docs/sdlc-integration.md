## SDLC Overview

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic approach to software development that ensures quality, reliability, and maintainability. Traditional SDLC methodologies include Waterfall, Agile, DevOps, and hybrid approaches. Each phase serves a critical purpose in delivering successful software solutions.

### Traditional SDLC Phases

1. **Planning & Requirements Gathering**
2. **System Design & Architecture**
3. **Implementation & Development**
4. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
5. **Deployment & Release**
6. **Maintenance & Evolution**

### Modern SDLC Challenges

- **Context Management**: Maintaining project knowledge across teams and time
- **Quality Consistency**: Ensuring standards across different development phases
- **Documentation Drift**: Keeping documentation synchronized with code changes
- **Traceability Gaps**: Linking requirements to implementation to testing
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Onboarding new team members efficiently
- **Risk Management**: Identifying and mitigating project risks early
