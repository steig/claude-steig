# Migration Guide: Upgrading to Simone v3.2.0

**Version**: 3.2.0  
**Release Date**: 2025-07-15  
**Migration Type**: Backward Compatible Enhancement

## Overview

Simone v3.2.0 introduces major UX improvements while maintaining 100% backward compatibility. Existing projects will continue to work unchanged, but can optionally adopt new simplified workflows.

## What's New

### Progressive Complexity System
- **New Quick Start Path**: 15-minute setup with `simone quickstart`
- **Simple Commands**: `simone quick`, `simone auto`, `simone doctor`
- **Quality Escape Hatches**: `--urgent`, `--bypass`, `--simple` flags
- **Feature Enablement**: Add capabilities with `simone enable`

### Enhanced Infrastructure
- **Docker Auto-Detection**: Automatic port conflict resolution
- **Setup Reliability**: 95%+ success rate with auto-fix capabilities
- **Data Export**: Complete project export in multiple formats

## Migration Paths

### Option 1: Keep Existing Workflow (Recommended)
**No action required** - All existing commands and workflows continue to work exactly as before.

```bash
# These continue to work unchanged
simone init
simone task create
/project:simone:do_task T001
/project:simone:create_milestone
```

### Option 2: Gradual Adoption
Adopt new features incrementally while keeping existing setup:

```bash
# Try new quick commands for simple tasks
simone quick "Fix styling bug"

# Use escape hatches for urgent work
simone task create --urgent

# Add health monitoring
simone doctor

# Export data for backup
simone export json backup.json
```

### Option 3: Fresh Start (New Teams)
For new projects or teams wanting to experience the full UX improvement:

```bash
# Start fresh with quickstart
simone quickstart

# Use simple workflows
simone quick "Implement login"
simone auto T1234

# Add features as needed
simone enable quality
simone enable mcp
```

## Backward Compatibility

### 100% Command Compatibility
All existing commands work unchanged:
- ✅ `simone init` - Still available with full enterprise setup
- ✅ `simone task create` - Maintains existing behavior
- ✅ All Claude Code commands - No changes required
- ✅ Quality enforcement - Same validation rules (with new escape hatches)

### Project Structure Compatibility
- ✅ Existing `.simone/` directories work unchanged
- ✅ All metadata and documentation preserved
- ✅ Template system remains compatible
- ✅ MCP server integration unchanged

### Workflow Compatibility
- ✅ Enterprise workflows continue as before
- ✅ Quality gates maintain same standards (with optional bypasses)
- ✅ Automation commands work unchanged
- ✅ All existing documentation remains valid

## New Capabilities

### Quick Start Workflow
```bash
# New 15-minute setup
simone quickstart
# vs traditional 2-4 week setup
simone init # (still available)
```

### Simplified Task Creation
```bash
# New simple task creation
simone quick "Fix button styling"
# vs traditional task creation
simone task create # (still available)
```

### Quality Flexibility
```bash
# New quality escape hatches
simone task create --urgent    # Relaxed validation
simone task create --bypass    # Skip validation
simone task create --simple    # Minimal metadata
# vs traditional (still default)
simone task create             # Full validation
```

### Progressive Feature Addition
```bash
# New incremental feature enablement
simone enable quality      # Add quality system
simone enable mcp         # Add MCP servers
simone enable automation  # Add automation
simone enable performance # Add performance features
```

### Health Monitoring
```bash
# New diagnostic capabilities
simone doctor              # Health check
simone export json        # Data export
```

## Recommended Adoption Strategy

### For Existing Teams
1. **Week 1**: Continue existing workflows, try `simone doctor` for health checks
2. **Week 2**: Experiment with `simone quick` for simple tasks
3. **Week 3**: Use quality escape hatches (`--urgent`) for time-critical work
4. **Month 1**: Gradually adopt new commands based on team preference

### For New Teams
1. **Start with**: `simone quickstart` for immediate productivity
2. **Add features**: Use `simone enable` commands as needs grow
3. **Scale up**: Transition to full enterprise features when ready

## Configuration Changes

### No Configuration Required
- All existing configurations continue to work
- No environment variables need updating
- No template modifications required
- No MCP server reconfiguration needed

### Optional Enhancements
```bash
# Optional: Enable new health monitoring
simone doctor

# Optional: Export existing project data
simone export json project-backup.json

# Optional: Test Docker improvements
./scripts/mcp-docker.sh setup  # Enhanced with auto-detection
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Questions

**Q: Will my existing tasks and sprints continue to work?**
A: Yes, 100% compatibility. All existing work items function unchanged.

**Q: Do I need to reconfigure my MCP servers?**
A: No, existing MCP server configurations work unchanged. New setup scripts provide better reliability for new installations.

**Q: Will the quality enforcement system change my workflow?**
A: No, existing quality standards remain the same. New escape hatches provide flexibility when needed.

**Q: Can I mix old and new command styles?**
A: Yes, you can use `simone init` for setup and `simone quick` for simple tasks in the same project.

### If You Encounter Issues

1. **Check health**: `simone doctor`
2. **Verify setup**: Existing commands should work unchanged
3. **Export data**: `simone export json` for backup
4. **Rollback**: Previous versions remain available if needed
