```

### Full Feature Development
For developers wanting maximum automation insight and control:

```bash
# Enable all transparency features
simone checkpoints enable
simone decisions enable

# Preview before executing automation
simone preview T001

# Run automation with checkpoints
/project:simone:do_task_auto T001 --checkpoints

# Monitor and control during execution
simone checkpoints list
simone checkpoints approve

# Full data backup capability
simone export backup complete-backup
```
