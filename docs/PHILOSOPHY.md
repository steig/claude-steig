# The Simone Philosophy

## The Problem We're Solving

Every project management tool follows the same tragic arc:

1. **Birth**: "We just need to track tasks"
2. **Growth**: "Let's add priorities"  
3. **Complexity**: "We need workflows"
4. **Bureaucracy**: "Required fields for compliance"
5. **Death**: "I'll just keep it in my head"

This progression can result in tools that require significant overhead to maintain.

## Our Core Beliefs

### 1. Simplicity as a Core Feature

```bash
# This is a perfect task manager:
echo "Fix login bug" >> tasks.txt

# Everything else is optional
```

### 2. Complexity Should Be Earned, Not Imposed

You shouldn't pay for complexity you don't use:
- 1 person doesn't need assignments
- 10 tasks don't need priorities  
- Simple bugs don't need workflows

### 3. Tools Should Adapt to Humans

Not the other way around. Simone grows with you:
- Solo → Simple mode
- Busy → Organize mode
- Team → Team mode
- Enterprise → Full mode

### 4. Fast is a Feature

```bash
time simone add "Fix bug"
# real    0m0.003s  ✓

time jira create issue --type=Bug --summary="Fix bug" ...
# real    0m4.827s  ✗
```

Minimizing latency helps maintain development flow.

### 5. Data Liberation is a Human Right

Your tasks are YOUR tasks:
- No database lock-in
- No proprietary formats
- No cloud dependencies
- Just markdown files

### 6. AI Changes Everything

AI assistants like Claude Code work effectively with clear, simple structures:
```markdown
# Fix login bug
User reports 404 on login.
Check auth service.
```

This level of detail is typically sufficient for AI assistance.

## Design Principles

### Progressive Disclosure
Show only what's needed now. Hide complexity until requested.

### Reversible Decisions
Every feature addition can be undone. Every mode can be simplified.

### Convention Over Configuration
Smart defaults. Zero config to start. Customize only when needed.

### Fail Gracefully
When something breaks, you can still read your tasks with `cat`.

### Optimize for the Common Case
- Most tasks are simple
- Most projects are small
- Most teams are <10 people
- Design for the 90%, not the 10%

## Scope and Limitations

- **Not a comprehensive project management suite** - Designed for task tracking, not full enterprise PM
- **Not methodology-specific** - No built-in Scrum, Kanban, or other process frameworks
- **Not a collaboration platform** - Focuses on task management rather than team communication
- **Not a metrics dashboard** - Though data can be exported for analysis
- **Not a novel concept** - Builds on established file and folder patterns

## The Simone Promise

1. **You can start using Simone in 30 seconds**
2. **You'll be productive in 1 minute**
3. **You'll only learn what you need**
4. **You can leave anytime with your data**
5. **It will never be slower than `echo`**

## Success Metrics

We measure success by what we DON'T have:
- No learning curve
- No vendor lock-in  
- No required fields
- No loading screens
- No subscription fees
- No complexity debt

## The Future

Simone will evolve, but these will remain true:
- The simple mode will always be simple
- The core 5 commands will never change
- Files will always be markdown
- Speed will always matter
- You'll always own your data

## A Personal Note

Simone was developed to address common pain points:
- Opening Jira feeling dread
- Forgetting tasks because creation was too slow
- Teaching new tools to new developers
- Migrating between systems
- Paying for features we don't use

These experiences informed Simone's design priorities. Users who prefer comprehensive tools can enable full mode for additional features.

## In Closing

> "A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

We started by taking everything away. 

You decide what to add back.
